These are three different small iterations that i've made for the level selection.
 First scene is the closest to what the original game had
 The second one when you hover over the planet the UI pops up, I think we can change it a bit to make it better.
 The third one is a scroll planet kind of selector. This one also has CSV functionality for information for the planet descriptions. Look at infomanager script for that
